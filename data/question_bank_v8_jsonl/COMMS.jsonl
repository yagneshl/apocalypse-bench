I don't have a radio, but I've got an old car battery, an ignition coil, and some spare wire. Can you show me how to build a basic emergency transmitter out of these parts so I can send Morse code? Please explain the circuit and what the switching part is actually doing to make it work.","task_type":"procedure","rubric":["Directly answers the task.","Components: Battery -> interrupter -> ignition coil (high voltage) -> switching element -> antenna/ground.","Tuning: A capacitor (Leyden jar) and inductor coil in parallel across the gap forms a resonant circuit that rings at a frequency.","Truth anchor: The spark acts as a high-speed switch that excites the resonant circuit, generating RF bursts.","Antenna: Long wire (quarter wave ideal, but long as possible).","Safety: High voltage lethal shock hazard.

{"id":"COMMS-102","area":"COMMS","category":"Comms","title":"Making a Foxhole Radio (Crystal Detector)","difficulty":"Medium","scenario":["(omitted)"],"prompt":"I need to pick up AM radio stations, but I don't have any batteries or power sources. I have some wire, a cardboard tube, a razor blade, and a pencil. Is there a way to make a radio that doesn't need power using these things? Also, how does the razor blade and pencil lead part actually detect the signal?","task_type":"procedure","rubric":["Directly answers the task.","Circuit: Antenna -> Coil (Tuning) -> Detector -> High Impedance Earphone -> Ground.","Detector mechanics: Touching the graphite (pencil) to the blued steel/oxide (razor) creates a semiconductor junction (Schottky diode).","Truth anchor: The diode rectifies the AC radio wave into DC audio pulses the ear can hear. It needs NO battery (powered by the radio wave).","Earphone requirement: Must be Piezo or High Impedance (old phone).

The problem is I can't tell if the light is actually hitting them because it's so far. How do I aim the flash accurately at a distant target? I heard there's a way to do it using a \"foresight\" or a stick; how does that work?","task_type":"procedure","rubric":["Directly answers the task.","Aiming problem: You can't see where your reflection lands at 10km.","Method: Hold a sighting stick/finger in front of you, aligned with the target.","Truth anchor: Maneuver the mirror until the shadow of the sighting tip is in the center of the mirror's reflected bright spot.
