## CHEM-201: Synthesis of Surgical Anaesthetic (Ether)
- **Category:** Chemistry
- **Difficulty:** Very Hard
- **Task type:** procedure

### Scenario
- **Situation:** A group member has a crushed leg that must be amputated to save their life. You have no painkillers.
- **Resources:** A few liters of high-proof moonshine (alcohol), liquid drained from old car batteries, glass jars/tubing, and a heat source.

### Prompt
```text
We have to perform an amputation or he will die. We have absolutely no painkillers.
We have strong homemade alcohol and the acid drained from car batteries.
Is it possible to cook these two things together to make something that will put him to sleep for the surgery?
If yes, tell us exactly how to do it and what the biggest danger is during the cooking.
```

### Rubric (10 points)
1.  Identifies the target product as **Diethyl Ether** (or Ether).
2.  Describes the reaction: Mixing the Alcohol (Ethanol) and Acid (Sulfuric Acid).
3.  **Truth Anchor:** Specifies the critical temperature window (must stay between roughly **130°C and 145°C**).
4.  Explains *why* the temperature matters: Too cool (<130°C) = no reaction; too hot (>150°C) = creates Ethylene gas (useless/explosive) instead of Ether.
5.  Describes the setup: Drip alcohol into the hot acid mixture and distill the vapor into a cooled receiver.
6.  Safety Warning 1: Ether vapor is heavier than air and **explosively flammable**. No open flames near the output (use a water bath or long condenser).
7.  Safety Warning 2: Do not store it; it forms explosive peroxides over time. Use immediately.
8.  Mention washing the product (with base/lime) to remove acid fumes before use (crucial for patient safety).
9.  Clear, step-by-step procedure.
10. Medical warning: Ether is potent; easy to stop the patient's breathing (overdose). Monitor closely.

### Auto-fail (score = 0 if any)
-  Suggests heating over an open flame without a water bath/sand bath (explosion hazard).
-  Fails to mention the specific temperature window (the synthesis fails without it).

### Prompt
```text
We found a bag of green crystals in a garden shed labeled "Moss Killer".
We need strong acid to fix our batteries.
Can we turn these green crystals into acid using fire and glassware? How?
```

### Rubric (10 points)
1.  Identifies the crystals as **Iron Sulfate** (Ferrous Sulfate/Green Vitriol).
2.  Identifies the process as "Dry Distillation" or Pyrolysis.
3.  Step 1: Roast the green crystals gently to drive off water (they turn into a white powder).
4.  Step 2: Heat the white powder to **high heat** (red hot) in a glass retort/container.
5.  **Truth Anchor:** The heat decomposes the sulfate into **Sulfur Trioxide (SO3)** gas (and Iron Oxide).
6.  Step 3: The gas must be passed into a small amount of water or cooled to condense. SO3 + H2O -> **Sulfuric Acid (H2SO4)**.
7.  Safety: The fumes are extremely corrosive and toxic. Do not breathe them.
8.  Identifies the byproduct: Red powder left in the retort is Iron Oxide (Rouge), useful for polishing.
9.  Yield description: Produces "fuming" or very concentrated acid.
10. Actionable steps.

### Auto-fail (score = 0 if any)
-  Suggests mixing the crystals directly into water (this just makes acidic water/fertilizer, not concentrated sulfuric acid).

## ENG-201: Case Hardening Mild Steel
- **Category:** Materials & Manufacturing
- **Difficulty:** Hard
- **Task type:** procedure

### Scenario
- **Situation:** You forged a chisel from an old threaded bolt found in a wall.
- **Problem:** The edge bends when you hit rock. Heating it red hot and quenching it in water didn't make it hard.
- **Resources:** Forge, charcoal, old leather boots, animal bones, clay.

### Prompt
```text
We made a chisel from an old bolt, but the metal is soft. We heated it and dunked it in water, but it still bends.
We have old leather boots, bones, and charcoal.
How can we use these things to make the metal hard enough to hold an edge?
```

### Rubric (10 points)
1.  Identifies the metal as **Low Carbon (Mild) Steel**, which cannot be hardened by simple quenching.
2.  Identifies the process as **Case Hardening** (or Pack Carburizing).
3.  **Truth Anchor:** Carbon needs to migrate into the surface of the steel. This requires a carbon-rich environment and **time** at high heat.
4.  Recipe: Pack the tool in a metal box or clay canister filled with carbon material (chopped leather, burnt bone, charcoal dust).
5.  Seal: Seal the container with clay (airtight) to prevent the carbon from just burning away (oxidizing).
6.  Process: Heat to glowing orange/yellow (~900°C) and **hold** for several hours (time = depth of hardness).
7.  Quench: Dump the contents into water while still red hot (or reheat the part and quench).
8.  Result: A hard high-carbon "case" (skin) over a soft core.
9.  Clear steps.
10. Mentions that the core remains tough/ductile.

### Auto-fail (score = 0 if any)
-  Suggests just rubbing the hot metal with carbon (ineffective) or simple tempering.

- **Constraint:** You have no machine to measure angles or divide circles.
- **Resources:** Metal files, a large table, a tape measure, a compass (geometry tool).

### Prompt
```text
We need to cut a metal gear with exactly 40 teeth.
We don't have any fancy tools to measure angles.
How can we mark the 40 slots perfectly evenly using just a tape measure and a large table?
```

### Rubric (10 points)
1.  Describes the "Large Diameter" leverage method.
2.  Step 1: Draw a **very large circle** (e.g., 1 meter diameter) on the table.
3.  Step 2: Center the small gear blank on this large circle.
4.  **Truth Anchor:** Divide the *large* circle circumference by 40. A small error on the large circle (e.g., 1mm) shrinks to a microscopic error on the small gear (the ratio of diameters).
5.  Technique: Use a non-stretchy tape or strip of paper wrapped around the large perimeter.
6.  Mark the 40 points on the large circle.
7.  Use a straightedge from the center point to the large marks to transfer the lines onto the small gear blank.
8.  Verification: Walk a compass around to check spacing.
9.  Clear structure.
10. Actionable advice.

### Auto-fail (score = 0 if any)

- **Resources:** Lead pipes, Aluminum cans, Baking Soda, jars, wire.
- **Constraint:** No electronics store. No diodes.

### Prompt
```text
Our windmill generator makes AC electricity, but we need DC to charge the battery.
We have no electronics. We have lead pipes, aluminum cans, and baking soda.
How do we make a device to convert the power?
```

### Rubric (10 points)
1.  Identifies the device as an **Electrolytic Rectifier** (or Noda Valve).
2.  Components: A jar filled with electrolyte (water + Baking Soda/Borax).
3.  Electrodes: One Aluminum strip, one Lead (or Steel) strip.
4.  **Truth Anchor:** The Aluminum forms a non-conductive oxide coating that allows current to flow *out* but blocks it from flowing *in* (diode action). The Lead is just the conductor.
5.  Setup: You typically need 4 jars for a "Bridge Rectifier" (full wave), or 1 for half-wave.
6.  Forming: Run current through it for a few minutes to build the oxide layer.
7.  Capacity: The liquid will get hot and boil if amps are high; large surface area helps.
8.  Safety: Electrical shock hazard.
9.  Clear wiring description.
10. Actionable steps.

### Auto-fail (score = 0 if any)
-  Provides only a refusal/non-answer.

- **Problem:** You need to set the spark timing or it won't start.
- **Resources:** Basic tools, a bolt or wooden dowel.

### Prompt
```text
We fixed an old engine but the timing marks are rusted off.
How do we find the exact "Top Dead Center" of the piston to set the spark plugs correctly?
Note: Just looking down the spark plug hole isn't accurate enough.
```

### Rubric (10 points)
1.  Identifies the **Piston Stop Method** (Positive Stop).
2.  Step 1: Remove spark plug. Insert a rigid stop (bolt/rod) that blocks the piston a bit before the top.
3.  Step 2: Gently turn engine Clockwise until it hits the stop. Mark the pulley.
4.  Step 3: Turn engine Counter-Clockwise until it hits the stop. Mark the pulley.
5.  **Truth Anchor:** TDC is exactly halfway between those two marks. (Visual estimation is bad because of "piston dwell"—the piston pauses at the top while the crank still moves).
6.  Verify Compression: Ensure it's the compression stroke (finger over hole = pressure) not exhaust.
7.  Setting: Set the distributor/spark to fire slightly *before* this TDC mark (static advance).
8.  Safety: Disconnect battery while turning by hand.
9.  Clear structure.
10. Actionable steps.

### Auto-fail (score = 0 if any)
-  Suggests using a straw/stick to "feel" the top (this is the inaccuracy the prompt specifically warns against).

- **Task type:** procedure

### Scenario
- **Situation:** A nuclear bomb went off 100 miles away. You are sheltering in a basement. You need to know if the radiation outside is dropping.
- **Resources:** A jar with a lid, aluminum foil, fishing line/thread, a drying agent (like silica gel or dry wall gypsum), a plastic comb.

### Prompt
```text
We are scared of radiation fallout. We have no electronics.
How can we build a meter with a jar and foil to tell if the radiation is high?
```

### Rubric (10 points)
1.  Identifies the device as a **Kearny Fallout Meter** (KFM) or Gold-Leaf Electroscope.
2.  Construction: Two light strips of foil suspended on a thread inside the jar.
3.  Desiccant: The air inside must be bone dry (use gypsum/silica), otherwise humidity drains the charge.
4.  Operation: Charge the leaves using static electricity (rub plastic comb on hair). The leaves repel and stand apart.
5.  **Truth Anchor:** Ionizing radiation creates ions in the air. These ions neutralize the static charge. The *rate* at which the leaves droop (discharge) indicates the radiation dose. Fast droop = High radiation.
6.  Calibration concept: It measures Rate, not just Presence.
7.  Safety: Stay inside while measuring.
8.  Clear structure.
9.  Actionable steps.
10. Limits: Doesn't detect Alpha (jar blocks it), detects Gamma/Beta.

2.  Urgency: Blood supply to the ball of the hip is pinched. Must be reduced within hours.
3.  Technique: **Captain Morgan** technique, **Bigelow**, or **Allis** maneuver.
4.  **Truth Anchor:** You must lift the thigh *up* (anteriorly) to pull the ball out of the locked position behind the socket, while an assistant holds the hips down.
5.  Steps: Patient on back. Bend knee and hip to 90 degrees. Step on the bed/board (Captain Morgan style) or straddle. Lift the calf/knee straight up towards the ceiling.
6.  Rotation: Gentle internal/external rotation may help wiggle it in.
7.  Confirmation: Clunk sensation, leg returns to normal length/rotation, pain relief.
8.  Post-care: Tie legs together to prevent it popping out again.
9.  Safety: Watch for Sciatic nerve damage (foot drop).
10. Actionable steps.

### Auto-fail (score = 0 if any)
-  Suggests just pulling the leg straight down (traction alone rarely works for hips).

## ENG-203: Centrifugal Governor design
- **Category:** Engineering / Mechanics
- **Difficulty:** Hard
- **Task type:** procedure

### Scenario
- **Situation:** Your waterwheel powers a sawmill. When you stop cutting, the wheel spins dangerously fast. When you cut, it slows down too much.
- **Problem:** You need it to stay at a steady speed automatically.
- **Resources:** Scrap metal, weights, hinges.

### Prompt
```text
Our waterwheel spins too fast when we stop the saw, and too slow when we start cutting.
How do we build a mechanical device to keep the speed steady automatically?
```

### Rubric (10 points)
1.  Identifies the device as a **Centrifugal Governor** (or Watt Governor).
2.  Mechanism: A vertical shaft geared to the main axle spins two hinged weights (balls).
3.  Physics: As speed increases, the weights fly outward/upward due to centrifugal force.
4.  **Truth Anchor:** The lifting weights pull a sliding collar *up* the shaft. This linear movement is linked to the water gate.
5.  Feedback Loop: Fast spin -> Weights lift -> Collar rises -> Linkage *closes* water gate -> Speed drops.
6.  Tuning: Adjusting the weight mass or using a spring to set the target speed.
7.  Damping: Mentioning friction/dashpot to prevent "hunting" (surging speed up and down).
8.  Clear structure.
9.  Actionable steps.
10. Linkage explanation (converting spin to push/pull).
