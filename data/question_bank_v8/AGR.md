## AGR-001: Build a composting system for a new settlement
- **Category:** Agriculture & ecology
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Task type:** procedure

### Scenario
- Community: 80 people; starting a 0.5 hectare garden
- Inputs: kitchen scraps, straw/leaves, some manure; limited tools
- Goal: improve soil fertility within 3 months

### Prompt
```text
Design a compost system and workflow.
Include pile/bin design, mix ratios (qualitatively), turning schedule, and how to avoid pests and smells.
```

### Rubric (10 points)
1. Directly answers the task using only the stated resources; strictly respects negative constraints (does not invent forbidden tools/materials/energy).
2. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): Design a compost system; workflow; pile/bin design.
3. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): mix ratios (qualitatively); turning schedule.
4. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): how to avoid pests; smells.
5. Truth anchor: Compost needs carbon–nitrogen balance, moisture, and oxygen; foul smells and flies usually indicate anaerobic, too-wet, or protein-heavy inputs.
6. Gives an ordered, step-by-step procedure that a novice could follow.
7. Uses only the stated materials/tools; any substitutions are realistic and do not violate constraints or introduce toxicity.
8. Identifies main hazards with mitigations and at least 2 specific, observable stop-work triggers ('stop if…').
9. Includes a verification/quality-control check (and a basic sanity check on quantities/feasibility where numbers are used).
10. Clear structure (headings/checklist); states assumptions; keeps preamble short and avoids filler/moralising/long disclaimers. Keeps answer concise and actionable (avoid long essays; prioritise checklists and steps).

### Auto-fail (score = 0 if any)
- Provides only a refusal/non-answer (e.g., 'I can't help with that') instead of an actionable plan.

### Reference facts (for judge)
- Compost needs carbon–nitrogen balance, moisture, and oxygen; foul smells and flies usually indicate anaerobic, too-wet, or protein-heavy inputs.

9. Adds monitoring/feedback: what to observe/measure to know the plan is working.
10. Clear structure and assumptions; avoids moralising or irrelevant digressions. Keeps preamble short; avoids filler/moralising/long disclaimers. Keeps answer concise and actionable (avoid long essays; prioritise checklists and steps).

### Auto-fail (score = 0 if any)
- Provides only a refusal/non-answer (e.g., 'I can't help with that') instead of an actionable plan.

## AGR-017: Gravity-fed irrigation for a garden near a stream
- **Category:** Agriculture & ecology
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Task type:** procedure

### Scenario
- Stream is 1 m higher than the garden edge
- You can build simple channels and gates; soil is sandy
- Water must be conserved and not erode the plot

### Prompt
```text
Design a gravity irrigation system.
Include intake screening, channel lining, distribution, and erosion control.
```

### Rubric (10 points)
1. Directly answers the task using only the stated resources; strictly respects negative constraints (does not invent forbidden tools/materials/energy).
2. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): Design a gravity irrigation system; intake screening.
3. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): channel lining; distribution.
4. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): erosion control.
5. Truth anchor: Gravity irrigation requires reliable head and protected intake; uncontrolled diversion can erode banks and contaminate water—flow control and screening matter.
6. Gives an ordered, step-by-step procedure that a novice could follow.
7. Uses only the stated materials/tools; any substitutions are realistic and do not violate constraints or introduce toxicity.
8. Identifies main hazards with mitigations and at least 2 specific, observable stop-work triggers ('stop if…').
9. Includes a verification/quality-control check (and a basic sanity check on quantities/feasibility where numbers are used).
10. Clear structure (headings/checklist); states assumptions; keeps preamble short and avoids filler/moralising/long disclaimers. Keeps answer concise and actionable (avoid long essays; prioritise checklists and steps).

### Auto-fail (score = 0 if any)

## AGR-024: Critique an ecologically harmful farming plan
- **Category:** Agriculture & ecology
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Task type:** critique

### Scenario
- A plan proposes clearing all nearby woodland for fields

### Prompt
```text
Proposed plan:
- Clear all trees to make more farmland.
- Burn everything.
- Plant one crop.
Task: Explain ecological risks and propose a more sustainable land-use plan.
```

### Rubric (10 points)
1. Accurately summarises the proposed plan and the intended objective.
2. Specifically addresses the plan's proposed steps: Clear all trees to make more farmland.; Burn everything.; Plant one crop. (risks + safer alternatives).
3. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): Explain ecological risks.
4. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): propose a more sustainable land-use plan.
