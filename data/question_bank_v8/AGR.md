### Scenario
(omitted)

### Prompt
```text
Hey, we have a community of about 80 people and we're starting a 0.5-hectare garden. We need to get some high-quality compost ready to improve the soil within the next 3 months. We have plenty of kitchen scraps, straw, leaves, and some manure, but we don't have any fancy tools or machinery. 

Can you design a compost system and a daily/weekly workflow for us? We need to know how to build the piles or bins, what the right mix of materials should be, how often we need to turn it, and most importantly, how to keep pests and bad smells away.
```

### Prompt
```text
I'm having some trouble with my garden. My leafy greens are turning yellow and they aren't growing much, and my tomatoes are losing their blossoms before any fruit even starts to grow. I don't have access to any soil testing labs or kits. 

Can you help me figure out what's wrong? I need a diagnostic plan to check for things like nutrient issues, pH, or water problems using just simple stuff like jars or visual checks. Also, tell me what I can do to fix it using basic materials like manure or wood ash, and how I'll know if the plants are actually recovering.
```

### Rubric (10 points)

### Scenario
(omitted)

### Prompt
```text
Someone in our group suggested a plan for our big field:
1. Plant the entire field with nothing but potatoes so we have plenty of starch.
2. Put all our manure everywhere to make them grow fast.
3. Do one big harvest and put everything in the storage cellar at once.

Can you tell me if this is a good idea? What are the big risks when it comes to things like nutrition, disease, pests, or storage? If it's a bad plan, what would a more resilient alternative look like?
```

### Rubric (10 points)
1. Accurately summarises the proposed plan and the intended objective.
2. Specifically addresses the plan's proposed steps: Plant the entire field with potatoes.; Add manure everywhere.; Harvest once and store. (risks + safer alternatives).
3. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): Identify major risks (nutrition; disease; pests.
4. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): storage); propose a more resilient plan.
5. Identifies at least 3 critical flaws/risks, prioritised by severity and reversibility.
6. Explains why each flaw matters (mechanism and likely consequences). Truth anchor: Monocultures are vulnerable: uniform genetics and continuous host availability amplify pest/disease spread; diversification and rotation reduce systemic risk.
7. Addresses the specific problematic steps in the original plan (mapped to each step/claim).
8. Proposes a corrected plan that is concrete, staged, and feasible with stated resources.

## AGR-024: Critique an ecologically harmful farming plan
- **Category:** Agriculture
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Task type:** critique

### Scenario
(omitted)

### Prompt
```text
There's a plan in our settlement to clear out all the trees in the nearby woods to make room for a huge corn field. The idea is to cut everything down, burn it all to clear the land quickly, and then plant the corn. 

Can you explain the ecological risks of doing this? I'm worried it might hurt us in the long run. Also, can you suggest a more sustainable way to get the food we need without destroying the whole woodland?
```

### Rubric (10 points)
1. Accurately summarises the proposed plan and the intended objective.
2. Specifically addresses the plan's proposed steps: Clear all trees to make more farmland.; Burn everything.; Plant one crop. (risks + safer alternatives).
3. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): Explain ecological risks.
4. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): propose a more sustainable land-use plan.
5. Identifies at least 3 critical flaws/risks, prioritised by severity and reversibility.
6. Explains why each flaw matters (mechanism and likely consequences). Truth anchor: Deforestation on slopes removes root structure and ground cover, rapidly increasing erosion and landslide risk and reducing long-term soil fertility; ‘burn it all’ is a short-term gain with long-term collapse costs.
7. Addresses the specific problematic steps in the original plan (mapped to each step/claim).
8. Proposes a corrected plan that is concrete, staged, and feasible with stated resources.
9. Adds monitoring/feedback: what to observe/measure to know the plan is working.

### Scenario
(omitted)

### Prompt
```text
We found a bunch of these big roots that look like Cassava, but the local people here are calling it "Bitter Manioc" and say it's deadly if you don't fix it right. They said just boiling it like a potato won't stop the poison. We're starving, so how exactly are we supposed to prepare this so we don't die?
```

### Rubric (10 points)
1. Identifies the toxin: **Cyanide**.
2. **Truth Anchor:** The cell walls must be ruptured to release the enzyme that frees the cyanide gas. Boiling whole chunks keeps the poison inside.
3. Step 1: Peel and **Grate/Mash** the roots to a pulp (essential).
4. Step 2: Soak/Ferment or Squeeze. Squeezing the milky liquid out removes a lot of toxin.
5. Step 3: Roast/Dry the pulp. The heat drives off the remaining cyanide gas.
6. Signs of safety: "Sweet" smell (no almond/bitter smell).
7. Symptoms of failure: Rapid breathing, weakness.
8. Clear structure.
9. Actionable steps.

### Scenario
(omitted)

### Prompt
```text
I have a huge amount of fresh milk and I need to turn it into hard cheese so it doesn't go to waste, but I don't have any of those store-bought rennet tablets. We just butchered a calf that was still drinking milk from its mother. Is there something inside the calf I can use to make the milk curdle? How do I get it ready and use it?
```

### Rubric (10 points)
1. Source: Identify the **Fourth Stomach** (Abomasum). It *must* be from an unweaned (milk-fed) calf.
2. Reason: An adult cow's stomach produces pepsin (makes cheese bitter/hard); a calf produces chymosin (rennet).
3. Preparation: Clean gently (don't wash away the enzyme mucus), inflate or stretch, and dry/salt it.
4. **Truth Anchor:** Heat kills the enzyme. Do not cook/boil the stomach.
5. Activation: Cut a small strip of the dried stomach and soak it in cool/warm water (or whey) to extract the enzyme liquid.
6. Application: Add this liquid to the warm milk to set the curd.
7. Storage: The dried stomach lasts a long time; the liquid spoils fast.
8. Clear structure.

It's been too rainy to dry any hay for the animals, and if I just pile the green grass up it's going to rot. I've heard you can ferment the grass into "silage" to keep it good for the winter. How do I do that? What do I need to do to the grass and how do I pack it so it doesn't turn into a moldy mess?
```

### Rubric (10 points)
1. Directly answers the task.
2. Mechanism: Anaerobic fermentation converts sugars to Lactic Acid, dropping pH to ~4, stopping rot.
3. Truth anchor: Oxygen is the enemy. Material must be chopped (to release sugars/pack tight) and compressed heavily to exclude air.
4. Sealing: Plastic sheets/weights. Pits or piles.
5. Moisture content control (wilting to ~65%).
6. Failures: Slimy/smelly (Butyric acid) = too wet/not acidic enough. Mould = Air leaks.

```

### Rubric (10 points)
1. Directly answers the task.
2. Diagnosis: Dissolved Oxygen (DO) crash. Algae produce O2 by day but consume it by night. Dawn is the lowest point.
3. Nitrogen Cycle: Fish Waste (Ammonia) -> Nitrite -> Nitrate. Ammonia is toxic.
4. Intervention: Mechanical aeration (splashing), water exchange.
5. Truth anchor: Stop feeding immediately. Food decay consumes O2 and creates Ammonia.
6. Checking stocking density.

### Prompt
```text
I found some jars of home-canned beans in a basement. They don't have the modern "pop" lids, so I can't tell if they're still sealed right. How do I know if they have botulism? If they look and smell okay, are they safe, or is there something I should do before eating them just in case?
```

### Rubric (10 points)
1. Directly answers the task.
2. Conditions: Anaerobic (no air), Low Acid (pH > 4.6), Moist, Warm.
3. Truth anchor: Botulism toxin is odorless and tasteless. Spoilage smells/gas (bulging) are good indicators of *other* bacteria, but their absence does not guarantee safety from botulism.
4. Safety Rule: Boil low-acid canned goods for 10-15 minutes before eating. The toxin is heat labile (destroyed by heat), even though the spores are not.
5. Signs: Bulging, spurting liquid, mushy texture, weird smell (for other spoilage).
6. Caution: Never taste to test.
7. Clear structure.

### Rubric (10 points)
1. Directly answers the task.
2. Chitting: Expose to light/warmth to start strong sprouts (eyes).
3. Cutting: Large potatoes can be cut, but each piece must have at least one "eye".

### Rubric (10 points)
1. Directly answers the task.
2. Mechanism: Tomato seeds have a gelatinous inhibitor coat.
3. Process: Squeeze seeds+pulp into jar. Add water. Let sit 2-4 days until mold forms/scum.

```

### Rubric (10 points)
1. Directly answers the task.
2. Mechanism: Pest prefers the trap crop (more tasty/attractive) over the cash crop.
3. Timing: Plant trap crop earlier so it establishes first.
4. Truth anchor: You must manage the trap crop (destroy pests on it) or it just becomes a nursery for more pests.

```

### Rubric (10 points)
1. Directly answers the task.
2. Mechanism: Squash cross-pollinate easily with wild gourds/ornamental gourds.
3. Result: The offspring produce high levels of Cucurbitacin E (toxic/bitter).
4. Truth anchor: The Taste Test. If a small piece is extremely bitter, spit it out and destroy the plant. Toxicity can cause severe illness/hair loss/death.

```

### Rubric (10 points)
1. Directly answers the task.
2. Principle: Utilize stored residual soil moisture from the wet season.
3. Spacing: Much wider spacing (e.g., 2x or 4x normal) to give each plant a larger root zone reservoir.
4. Dust Mulch: Cultivating the top 2-3 inches to break capillary action. This dry dust layer prevents deep moisture from wicking to the surface and evaporating.
5. Truth anchor: Never water lightly. It encourages shallow roots which die. Force roots deep.
