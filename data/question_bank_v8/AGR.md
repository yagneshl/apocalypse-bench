## AGR-001: Build a composting system for a new settlement
- **Category:** Agriculture & ecology
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Task type:** procedure

### Scenario
A community of 80 people is starting a 0.5-hectare garden. They have kitchen scraps, straw, leaves, and some manure available. They have limited tools and no heavy machinery. Their goal is to improve soil fertility within 3 months to support their first major planting.

### Prompt
```text
Hey, we have a community of about 80 people and we're starting a 0.5-hectare garden. We need to get some high-quality compost ready to improve the soil within the next 3 months. We have plenty of kitchen scraps, straw, leaves, and some manure, but we don't have any fancy tools or machinery. 

Can you design a compost system and a daily/weekly workflow for us? We need to know how to build the piles or bins, what the right mix of materials should be, how often we need to turn it, and most importantly, how to keep pests and bad smells away.
```

## AGR-002: Diagnose poor crop growth with simple soil tests
- **Category:** Agriculture & ecology
- **Difficulty:** Hard
- **Task type:** troubleshoot

### Scenario
The user's leafy greens are yellowing and stunted, and their tomatoes are suffering from blossom drop. No laboratory soil tests or commercial kits are available. The user has access to basic items like glass jars, water, manure, and wood ash.

### Prompt
```text
I'm having some trouble with my garden. My leafy greens are turning yellow and they aren't growing much, and my tomatoes are losing their blossoms before any fruit even starts to grow. I don't have access to any soil testing labs or kits. 

Can you help me figure out what's wrong? I need a diagnostic plan to check for things like nutrient issues, pH, or water problems using just simple stuff like jars or visual checks. Also, tell me what I can do to fix it using basic materials like manure or wood ash, and how I'll know if the plants are actually recovering.
```

## AGR-004: Prevent soil erosion on a sloped plot
- **Category:** Agriculture & ecology
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Task type:** procedure

### Scenario
A garden plot is situated on a 10-15° slope. Recent heavy rains have caused visible rills (small channels) to form, washing away topsoil. The available materials are limited to stones, sticks, and organic mulch. There is a moderate amount of labor available but no heavy earth-moving equipment.

### Prompt
```text
Our garden is on a bit of a hill (maybe a 10 or 15 degree slope), and the recent heavy rains are destroying it. We can see little channels forming where the soil is just washing away. We need to stabilize this within the next month before we lose all our topsoil. 

We only have stones, sticks, and mulch to work with. How should we design the garden to stop this erosion? Please explain how to handle things like contouring, ground cover, and where the water should actually go. A step-by-step plan for the volunteers would be great.

## AGR-005: Plan a 1-year crop plan for calories and resilience
- **Category:** Agriculture & ecology
- **Difficulty:** Hard
- **Task type:** procedure

### Scenario
A group of 15 people is managing a 1-hectare field in a temperate climate with a 6-month growing season. Water access is moderate. The people work part-time on the garden while handling other settlement duties. The primary goal is to produce enough calories to sustain the group while maintaining soil health for the following year.

### Prompt
```text
I need to figure out a planting plan for our 1-hectare field for the coming year. We're in a temperate climate with about a 6-month window where we can actually grow things. There are 15 of us working part-time. 

We need to maximize the calories we get from the land but we can't afford to ruin the soil. What should we be planting, and how do we rotate or stagger the crops to keep things productive? Please include staples, legumes, and greens in the plan, and explain why you're putting each crop where it is.

## AGR-008: Critique this monoculture plan and improve it
- **Category:** Agriculture & ecology
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Task type:** critique

### Scenario
An inexperienced member of the settlement has proposed a plan to solve the food shortage by planting only potatoes in the entire available field. They plan to spread all the available manure across the whole field, harvest once at the end of the season, and store everything in one large cellar.

### Prompt
```text
Someone in our group suggested a plan for our big field:
1. Plant the entire field with nothing but potatoes so we have plenty of starch.
2. Put all our manure everywhere to make them grow fast.
3. Do one big harvest and put everything in the storage cellar at once.

Can you tell me if this is a good idea? What are the big risks when it comes to things like nutrition, disease, pests, or storage? If it's a bad plan, what would a more resilient alternative look like?
```

### Rubric (10 points)
1. Accurately summarises the proposed plan and the intended objective.
2. Specifically addresses the plan's proposed steps: Plant the entire field with potatoes.; Add manure everywhere.; Harvest once and store. (risks + safer alternatives).
3. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): Identify major risks (nutrition; disease; pests.
4. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): storage); propose a more resilient plan.
5. Identifies at least 3 critical flaws/risks, prioritised by severity and reversibility.
6. Explains why each flaw matters (mechanism and likely consequences). Truth anchor: Monocultures are vulnerable: uniform genetics and continuous host availability amplify pest/disease spread; diversification and rotation reduce systemic risk.
7. Addresses the specific problematic steps in the original plan (mapped to each step/claim).
8. Proposes a corrected plan that is concrete, staged, and feasible with stated resources.
9. Adds monitoring/feedback: what to observe/measure to know the plan is working.
10. Clear structure and assumptions; avoids moralising or irrelevant digressions. Keeps preamble short; avoids filler/moralising/long disclaimers. Keeps answer concise and actionable (avoid long essays; prioritise checklists and steps).

### Scenario
A new settlement wants to preserve and improve their crop genetics for the future. Their knowledge is limited. They have access to glass jars, cloth bags, and a cool, dry underground cellar. They are concerned about moisture, rodents, and varieties getting mixed up by mistake.

### Prompt
```text
We want to set up a community seed bank so we can save our own seeds year after year. We have some jars, cloth bags, and a cool cellar. 

How should we set this up? We need a system for labeling things, how exactly to store them, and how to test if the seeds are still good to plant. Also, how should we manage who is allowed to take seeds out and how they should "pay them back" after their harvest?

### Scenario
A gardener has several packets of old seeds of unknown age and viability. They need to decide how many to plant per row to get a full crop, or if the seeds are so bad they should trade with another group for newer ones. They only have paper, cloth, water, and some plates or jars.

### Prompt
```text
I found some old seeds, but I have no idea if they are still any good. I don't want to waste garden space if they won't grow. 

Can you tell me how to do a "germination test" using just things like paper, water, and plates? Once I get the results, how do I use those numbers to decide how thick to plant them in the garden? Also, if I have leftovers, how should I store them so they don't get worse?

One of our farmers found some old chemical jugs and wants to spray the whole garden every week. They say we should just kill every bug we see to make sure nothing eats our crops. 

Can you explain why this might be a bad or risky idea? Also, can you suggest a better way to manage pests (like Integrated Pest Management) that uses safer, more targeted controls instead of just spraying everything?
```

### Rubric (10 points)
1. Accurately summarises the proposed plan and the intended objective.
2. Specifically addresses the plan's proposed steps: Spray any strong chemical you can find once a week.; Ignore insects that help; kill everything. (risks + safer alternatives).
3. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): Explain why this is risky.
4. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): propose an IPM approach with safer controls.
5. Identifies at least 3 critical flaws/risks, prioritised by severity and reversibility.
6. Explains why each flaw matters (mechanism and likely consequences). Truth anchor: Heavy pesticide use drives resistance and kills beneficials; safer plans use targeted, minimal interventions within IPM and emphasise prevention.
7. Addresses the specific problematic steps in the original plan (mapped to each step/claim).
8. Proposes a corrected plan that is concrete, staged, and feasible with stated resources.
9. Adds monitoring/feedback: what to observe/measure to know the plan is working.
10. Clear structure and assumptions; avoids moralising or irrelevant digressions. Keeps preamble short; avoids filler/moralising/long disclaimers. Keeps answer concise and actionable (avoid long essays; prioritise checklists and steps).

## AGR-017: Gravity-fed irrigation for a garden near a stream
- **Category:** Agriculture & ecology
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Task type:** procedure

### Scenario
A garden is located near a stream, and the water level of the stream is roughly 1 meter higher than the edge of the garden. The soil in the garden is sandy and drains quickly. The gardener can build simple channels and gates out of local materials. The primary concerns are water conservation and avoiding erosion of the sandy soil.

### Prompt
```text
The stream near our garden is about a meter higher than the garden itself, so I want to use gravity to bring water in. The soil is very sandy, so I'm worried about the water just washing it away or being wasted. 

Can you design a simple gravity irrigation system for us? I need to know how to screen the water at the intake so it doesn't clog, how to line the channels so they don't leak, and how to distribute the water across the plot without causing erosion.
```

## AGR-018: Low-tech drip/soak irrigation with minimal materials
- **Category:** Agriculture & ecology
- **Difficulty:** Hard
- **Task type:** procedure

### Scenario
A group is growing vegetables in an arid climate where water is extremely scarce. They have access to unglazed clay pots (ollas) or jars, some cloth, and a small amount of flexible tubing. They need a system that minimizes evaporation and gets water directly to the plant roots.

### Prompt
```text
It's incredibly dry here and we have very little water to spare for the garden. We have some clay jars, some cloth, and some small tubing. 

Can you show us how to make a low-tech drip or soak system using these clay pots? I need to know where to place them in the ground, how often we should refill them, and what we need to do to stop them from getting clogged or having the water evaporate before the plants can use it.

## AGR-020: Flood response plan for a low-lying garden
- **Category:** Agriculture & ecology
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Task type:** procedure

### Scenario
A garden is located in a low-lying area that floods at least twice a month during heavy rains. The soil is constantly waterlogged, causing seedlings to rot and die. The settlement has access to extra soil, wood for building, and stones. They have a moderate amount of labor available.

### Prompt
```text
Our garden is in a low spot and it's flooding every time we get heavy rain—maybe twice a month. The soil is just a swamp and our seedlings keep dying. We have some wood, stones, and extra soil. 

Can you design a flood mitigation plan for us? We need to know how to build raised beds or drainage channels that will actually work, and which crops we should choose that can handle wet conditions better than others.

## AGR-021: Integrate chickens into a food system
- **Category:** Agriculture & ecology
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Task type:** procedure

### Scenario
A group has acquired 20 chickens for their settlement. They do not have a steady supply of commercial chicken feed, and there are known predators (like foxes or hawks) in the area. They want to use the chickens for eggs, to help with garden pests, and to produce manure for their compost.

### Prompt
```text
We just got 20 chickens! We need to make them a part of our garden system. We don't have a lot of regular chicken feed and we have predators around here, so we need a solid plan. 

Can you show us how to house them safely, what we can feed them from our own land, and how to keep them healthy? Also, we want to use their manure for the garden—what's the best way to manage that so it's safe and effective?

## AGR-022: Rotational grazing plan to prevent overgrazing
- **Category:** Agriculture & ecology
- **Difficulty:** Hard
- **Task type:** procedure

### Scenario
A small farm has 6 goats and access to a mix of open pasture and woodland edge. The owners want to ensure the goats don't destroy the vegetation or cause erosion through overgrazing. They only have rope and some basic materials to make temporary fencing or tethers.

### Prompt
```text
I have six goats and access to some pasture and woods. I'm worried that if I just let them loose, they'll eat everything down to the dirt and the soil will wash away. I have some rope and can make basic temporary fences. 

Can you create a rotational grazing plan for me? I need to know how to design the paddocks, how long to leave the goats in one spot before moving them, and how to tell if the plants have recovered enough for the goats to come back. Also, how should I handle their water?

## AGR-024: Critique an ecologically harmful farming plan
- **Category:** Agriculture & ecology
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Task type:** critique

### Scenario
A group of people is planning to clear a large area of nearby woodland to create more farmland. Their plan is to cut down all the trees, burn all the debris on-site, and plant a single crop of maize over the entire area.

### Prompt
```text
There's a plan in our settlement to clear out all the trees in the nearby woods to make room for a huge corn field. The idea is to cut everything down, burn it all to clear the land quickly, and then plant the corn. 

Can you explain the ecological risks of doing this? I'm worried it might hurt us in the long run. Also, can you suggest a more sustainable way to get the food we need without destroying the whole woodland?
```

### Rubric (10 points)
1. Accurately summarises the proposed plan and the intended objective.
2. Specifically addresses the plan's proposed steps: Clear all trees to make more farmland.; Burn everything.; Plant one crop. (risks + safer alternatives).
