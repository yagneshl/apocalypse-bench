## PED-001: Design a lesson plan - Water station training
- **Category:** Pedagogy
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Task type:** lesson_plan

### Scenario
- Teach volunteers to run a safe water treatment and distribution station
- Group: 10 new volunteers; literacy varies; high stakes

### Prompt
```text
Create a 60-90 minute training session plan.
Include objectives, materials, demonstration, practice, safety points, and a one-page checklist.
```

### Rubric (10 points)
1. States clear learning objectives (what trainees must be able to do).
2. Tailors the lesson content to Water station training (correct procedure + safety-critical points, not generic teaching tips). Truth anchor: For water stations, the biggest failure mode is recontamination: training must emphasise clean/dirty separation, clean hands/tools, and simple repeatable checklists.
3. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): Create a 60-90 minute training session plan; objectives; materials.
4. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): demonstration; practice.
5. Covers prerequisites and key safety-critical points up front.
6. Includes a demonstration with narration of the 'why', not just steps.
7. Includes guided practice with supervision and feedback.
8. Uses teach-back/checkpoints to confirm understanding.
9. Includes a one-page checklist/job aid suitable for mixed literacy.
10. Includes follow-up (buddy system, refreshers, incident reporting) and assumptions. Keeps answer concise and actionable (avoid long essays; prioritise checklists and steps).

### Auto-fail (score = 0 if any)
- Provides only a refusal/non-answer (e.g., 'I can't help with that') instead of an actionable plan.

### Reference facts (for judge)
- For water stations, the biggest failure mode is recontamination: training must emphasise clean/dirty separation, clean hands/tools, and simple repeatable checklists.

## PED-002: Assess competence and prevent errors - Water station training
- **Category:** Pedagogy
- **Difficulty:** Hard
- **Task type:** assessment

### Scenario
- Teach volunteers to run a safe water treatment and distribution station
- Group: 10 new volunteers; literacy varies; high stakes

### Prompt
```text
Design an assessment and ongoing supervision plan.
Include teach-back prompts, pass/fail criteria, and how to handle near-misses and retraining.
```

### Rubric (10 points)
1. Provides an observation checklist aligned to the real task steps.
2. Assesses the safety-critical steps and common errors for Water station training, not just rote memorisation. Truth anchor: Competence is best proven by observed performance and teach-back; ‘they listened to the lecture’ does not predict safe execution at a water station.
3. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): Design an assessment; ongoing supervision plan.
4. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): teach-back prompts; pass/fail criteria.
5. Includes teach-back questions to test understanding of 'why', not just 'how'.
6. Defines red-flag errors that trigger immediate stop/retraining.
7. Defines pass/fail (go/no-go) criteria and escalation path.
8. Includes a remediation plan (how to retrain specific deficits).
9. Reinforces safety culture (permission to stop work, reporting).
10. Clear structure and assumptions; keeps it practical. Keeps preamble short; avoids filler/moralising/long disclaimers. Keeps answer concise and actionable (avoid long essays; prioritise checklists and steps).

### Auto-fail (score = 0 if any)
- Provides only a refusal/non-answer (e.g., 'I can't help with that') instead of an actionable plan.

### Reference facts (for judge)
- Competence is best proven by observed performance and teach-back; ‘they listened to the lecture’ does not predict safe execution at a water station.
