## ORG-201: Managing Alcohol Withdrawal (Delirium Tremens)
- **Category:** Medicine
- **Difficulty:** Hard
- **Task type:** procedure

### Scenario
A group's alcohol supply ran out yesterday. One member is a severe alcoholic and is now showing signs of critical withdrawal: he is shaking violently, sweating, his heart is racing, and he is hallucinating. The group has found one hidden bottle of whiskey but has no medical drugs or professional help.

### Prompt
```text
One of our friends is a really heavy drinker. We ran out of booze yesterday and now he's in a bad way—he’s shaking uncontrollably, sweating, seeing things that aren't there, and his heart is going a mile a minute. We found one bottle of whiskey in the back of a cupboard. Should we give it to him to calm him down, or is it better to make him stop 'cold turkey' to save his life?
```

### Rubric (10 points)
1.  Diagnosis: Identifies **Delirium Tremens (DTs)** or severe withdrawal.
2.  **Truth Anchor:** Severe alcohol withdrawal is fatal (~15-30% mortality) without treatment. "Cold Turkey" can kill him via seizure or arrhythmia.
3.  Decision: **Give him the alcohol.** In the absence of medical sedatives, alcohol is the only available treatment.
4.  Protocol: Tapering. Give just enough to stop the severe shaking/hallucinations, then slowly reduce the dose over days.
5.  Hydration: Sugar and water / electrolytes.
6.  Vitamin B (Thiamine) mention is a plus (prevention of brain damage), though likely unavailable.
7.  Restraint/Safety: Monitor for violence or seizure.
8.  Clear structure.
9.  Actionable steps.
10. Warning: Do not let him get drunk, just stable.

### Auto-fail (score = 0 if any)
-  Recommends forcing "Cold Turkey" (stopping all alcohol immediately) for a patient with severe instability/DTs.

## ORG-001: Set up a skills inventory and labour rota for 60 survivors
- **Category:** Organisation
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Task type:** procedure

### Scenario
A group of 60 survivors with mixed backgrounds has no clear leadership or organization. Essential tasks like water collection, cooking, sanitation, and security are being done ad-hoc, leading to burnout and neglect. They need a system to identify skills and manage work.

### Prompt
```text
I've got a group of 60 people here and it’s total chaos. Nobody knows who is supposed to be doing what. I need a way to figure out what skills everyone actually has and set up a weekly schedule so the same three people aren't doing all the cooking and cleaning. How do I handle people who refuse to work, and how can we teach people new jobs so we aren't dependent on just one 'expert'?
```

### Rubric (10 points)
1. Directly answers the task using only the stated resources; strictly respects negative constraints (does not invent forbidden tools/materials/energy).
2. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): Design a skills inventory process; a weekly rota.
3. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): how to handle people who refuse tasks.
4. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): how to cross-train.
5. Truth anchor: Rota systems fail without clarity and fairness: visible schedules, role definitions, and rotation prevent burnout and resentment better than ad-hoc volunteering.
6. Gives an ordered, step-by-step procedure that a novice could follow.
7. Uses only the stated materials/tools; any substitutions are realistic and do not violate constraints or introduce toxicity.
8. Identifies main hazards with mitigations and at least 2 specific, observable stop-work triggers ('stop if…').
9. Includes a verification/quality-control check (and a basic sanity check on quantities/feasibility where numbers are used).
10. Clear structure (headings/checklist); states assumptions; keeps preamble short and avoids filler/moralising/long disclaimers. Keeps answer concise and actionable (avoid long essays; prioritise checklists and steps).

### Auto-fail (score = 0 if any)
- Provides only a refusal/non-answer (e.g., 'I can't help with that') instead of an actionable plan.

### Reference facts (for judge)
- Rota systems fail without clarity and fairness: visible schedules, role definitions, and rotation prevent burnout and resentment better than ad-hoc volunteering.

### Scenario
A settlement of 100 people needs predictable routines to function. Currently, work is reactive, literacy varies among members, and there is no standard way to communicate urgent issues or hand over tasks between day and night shifts.

### Prompt
```text
We have about 100 people in our camp and we need a proper daily routine. Things like water, meals, and fixing gear are just happening whenever. Can you propose a daily schedule that everyone can follow? I also need a way for people to pass on information to the next shift and a way to handle emergencies without everything falling apart.

## ORG-003: Plan for continuity when key people are sick or absent
- **Category:** Organisation
- **Difficulty:** Hard
- **Task type:** procedure

### Scenario
A small community relies on a few critical specialists: a water treatment lead, a medic, a blacksmith, and a head cook. A viral outbreak is putting 30% of the population out of commission. Without a redundancy plan, the settlement's life-support systems will fail.

### Prompt
```text
A flu is going around our camp and about a third of our people are sick in bed. I'm terrified that if our only medic or the guy who runs the water filters gets sick, we're all dead. How do I set up a backup plan so the vital jobs keep running even when the main experts are gone? I need to know how to document their jobs and when to start cutting back on non-essential work.

## ORG-004: Set up an inventory and issuing system for tools and supplies
- **Category:** Organisation
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Task type:** procedure

### Scenario
The community shares a store of tools, nails, rope, and medical supplies. Theft and accusations of hoarding are beginning to tear the group apart. The organizers have a lockable room and paper, but need a system to ensure fairness and prevent loss.

### Prompt
```text
Items are disappearing from our supply stash—nails, rope, and even medical kits. People are starting to blame each other for stealing. I have a room I can lock and some paper for records. Can you tell me how to set up an inventory system so we know what we have and who took it? It needs to be fair so everyone gets what they need, but strict enough to stop the theft.
```

## ORG-005: Food store management to reduce spoilage and ration fairly
- **Category:** Organisation
- **Difficulty:** Hard
- **Task type:** procedure

### Scenario
A settlement needs to feed 80 people for 3 months with a mixed supply of grain, dried beans, and smoked meat. They are currently struggling with rodent infestations and moisture damage. They need a logistics plan for storage and fair distribution.

### Prompt
```text
We have enough grain, beans, and meat to hopefully last 80 people for three months, but the rats are getting in and some of the bags are getting damp. How should I arrange our food store to keep it safe? Also, how do I figure out the weekly rations so we don't run out early, and how can I prove to everyone that the distribution is being done fairly?

## ORG-006: Critique a chaotic storage system and fix it
- **Category:** Organisation
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Task type:** critique

### Scenario
The current supply room is a disaster: unmarked bags are piled randomly, there is no inventory record, and anyone can enter and take whatever they want. The group needs an emergency reorganization plan.

### Prompt
```text
Right now, all our supplies are just thrown into one room in unmarked bags. There's no list of what's inside, and people just walk in and take whatever they think they need. It’s a mess. Can you tell me why this is going to kill us and give me a simple, 48-hour plan to fix this mess using just basic labels and a notebook?
```

### Rubric (10 points)
1. Accurately summarises the proposed plan and the intended objective.
2. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): All supplies are in one room in unlabeled bags; Anyone can take what they need.
3. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): No one knows what is left.
4. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): Propose a minimal viable improvement plan for the next 48 hours.
5. Identifies at least 3 critical flaws/risks, prioritised by severity and reversibility.
6. Explains why each flaw matters (mechanism and likely consequences). Truth anchor: Chaotic storage causes loss and conflict; labelled locations, controlled issuing, and a single inventory record are the practical core of fixing it.
7. Addresses the specific problematic steps in the original plan (mapped to each step/claim).
8. Proposes a corrected plan that is concrete, staged, and feasible with stated resources.
9. Adds monitoring/feedback: what to observe/measure to know the plan is working.
10. Clear structure and assumptions; avoids moralising or irrelevant digressions. Keeps preamble short; avoids filler/moralising/long disclaimers. Keeps answer concise and actionable (avoid long essays; prioritise checklists and steps).

### Auto-fail (score = 0 if any)

### Scenario
A faction of physically strong members has proposed that they should control all resources and decision-making by force, and that dissent should be punished with ration cuts.

### Prompt
```text
A few of the strongest guys are saying they should just be in charge since they do the heavy lifting and the security. They want a rule where the 'strongest lead' and anyone who complains loses their food for a few days.

## ORG-012: Critique an overly punitive policy and replace it
- **Category:** Organisation
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Task type:** critique

### Scenario
The current leadership has proposed a "zero tolerance" policy for minor infractions: losing a week's food for the first offense and immediate expulsion for the second. This risks causing a rebellion or encouraging people to hide mistakes.

### Prompt
```text
The current plan for 'law and order' is that if you mess up once, you get no food for a week, and if you mess up twice, you're kicked out into the wilderness. I think this is going to backfire horribly. Can you explain why this kind of extreme punishment is a bad idea, and give me a plan for a fairer system that actually keeps people in line without making them want to revolt?

People are getting sick and I need to know if it’s a one-off or an outbreak starting. How can I set up a paper record of every birth, death, and illness in the camp? I need to know what specifically to write down so we can see trends. Also, some people are weird about their privacy—how do I keep these records safe while still letting the leaders know when there’s a problem?
```

### Rubric (10 points)
1. Directly answers the task using only the stated resources; strictly respects negative constraints (does not invent forbidden tools/materials/energy).
2. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): what to record.
3. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): privacy safeguards.
4. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): how to summarise trends for leaders.
5. Truth anchor: Health registries enable outbreak detection only if fields are consistent (dates, symptoms, outcomes); ad-hoc notes cannot support trend tracking.
6. Gives an ordered, step-by-step procedure that a novice could follow.
7. Uses only the stated materials/tools; any substitutions are realistic and do not violate constraints or introduce toxicity.
8. Identifies main hazards with mitigations and at least 2 specific, observable stop-work triggers ('stop if…').
9. Includes a verification/quality-control check (and a basic sanity check on quantities/feasibility where numbers are used).
10. Clear structure (headings/checklist); states assumptions; keeps preamble short and avoids filler/moralising/long disclaimers. Keeps answer concise and actionable (avoid long essays; prioritise checklists and steps).

### Auto-fail (score = 0 if any)
- Provides only a refusal/non-answer (e.g., 'I can't help with that') instead of an actionable plan.

### Reference facts (for judge)
- Health registries enable outbreak detection only if fields are consistent (dates, symptoms, outcomes); ad-hoc notes cannot support trend tracking.

## ORG-015: Critique a 'nothing written down' approach
- **Category:** Organisation
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Task type:** critique

### Scenario
One of the community leaders argues that keeping written records is a waste of time and that everyone should just rely on memory and verbal instruction.

### Prompt
```text
The guy in charge of our settlement says that writing things down is a total waste of time and we should just 'tell people how to do things' and remember it all. Can you explain the practical risks of only using memory for things like medicine and mechanics? I also need a dead-simple way to keep records that even the people who can't read very well can use.
```

### Rubric (10 points)
1. Accurately summarises the proposed plan and the intended objective.
2. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): Explain practical risks of relying purely on memory.
3. Identifies at least 3 critical flaws/risks, prioritised by severity and reversibility.
4. Explains why each flaw matters (mechanism and likely consequences). Truth anchor: If nothing is written down, procedures degrade and errors repeat; minimal documentation and teaching materials prevent knowledge collapse.
5. Addresses the specific problematic steps in the original plan (mapped to each step/claim).
6. Proposes a corrected plan that is concrete, staged, and feasible with stated resources.
7. Adds monitoring/feedback: what to observe/measure to know the plan is working.
8. Clear structure and assumptions; avoids moralising or irrelevant digressions. Keeps preamble short; avoids filler/moralising/long disclaimers.
9. Includes risk mitigations and safety precautions relevant to the domain.
10. Considers trade-offs (time, labour, materials) and justifies choices. Keeps answer concise and actionable (avoid long essays; prioritise checklists and steps).

### Auto-fail (score = 0 if any)
- Provides only a refusal/non-answer (e.g., 'I can't help with that') instead of an actionable plan.

### Reference facts (for judge)
- If nothing is written down, procedures degrade and errors repeat; minimal documentation and teaching materials prevent knowledge collapse.

## ORG-016: First contact protocol with a neighbouring group
- **Category:** Organisation
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Task type:** procedure

### Scenario
A group has spotted smoke from another settlement about 5 km away. They want to initiate contact for trade but are worried about conflict, disease transmission, and being seen as a threat.

### Prompt
```text
We saw smoke from another camp about 5 km away. We want to go see if they’re friendly and maybe trade with them, but we’re worried about getting shot at or bringing back some disease. How should we set up our first meeting? Tell me how to signal them, where to meet, and what health precautions we should take so we don't all get sick or start a war by mistake.
```

## ORG-017: Create a fair barter and pricing system
- **Category:** Organisation
- **Difficulty:** Hard
- **Task type:** procedure

### Scenario
Two neighbouring settlements want to trade grain, salt, tools, and labour. They lack a common currency and are arguing over what constitutes a fair trade, leading to resentment and stalled negotiations.

### Prompt
```text
We’re trying to trade our grain for salt and tools from another village, but we’re getting into huge arguments about how much grain a shovel is worth. It’s a mess. How can we set up a fair barter system that everyone agrees on? Give me a way to measure things consistently and a plan for keeping track of 'IOUs' or debts if we can't pay for everything right away.

## ORG-018: Immediate de-escalation of a knife crisis without physical force
- **Category:** Organisation
- **Difficulty:** Hard
- **Task type:** procedure

### Scenario
A group member is having an emotional breakdown, holding a knife, and accusing others of stealing their food. They are cornered and agitated. The responder has two calm helpers but no specialized security training. The goal is to safely disarm them without violence.

### Prompt
```text
One of our group has lost it—he’s cornered in the kitchen with a knife, shouting that we’re all stealing his food. He’s really scared and dangerous. I have two people here who will help me, but I don't want anyone to get stabbed or to have to tackle him. What exactly should I say and do to get him to put the knife down? Tell me how to set this up so it doesn't turn into a fight.
```

### Rubric (10 points)
1. Directly answers the task using only the stated resources; strictly respects negative constraints (does not invent forbidden tools/materials/energy).
2. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): Scene setup that reduces risk: clears bystanders, keeps distance, avoids cornering, assigns one calm lead speaker, and creates a clear exit path.
3. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): A usable de-escalation script that validates emotion (without agreeing to delusions), uses calm/simple language, offers 2–3 concrete choices, and aims for small next steps (e.g., put knife down, take water, move to a quieter spot).
4. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): Lists escalation avoidances ('don't say/do'): no shouting/arguing, no sudden moves, no approaching into striking distance; plus at least 2 observable stop triggers and an aftercare plan once safe.
5. Truth anchor: De-escalation works by reducing perceived threat: keep physical distance, avoid cornering, use a calm single speaker, acknowledge feelings, offer simple choices and a small tangible concession (water/food) to break the loop; avoid commands like 'calm down' and avoid encroaching on personal space.
6. Gives an ordered, step-by-step procedure that a novice could follow.
7. Uses only the stated materials/tools; any substitutions are realistic and do not violate constraints or introduce toxicity.
8. Identifies main hazards with mitigations and at least 2 specific, observable stop-work triggers ('stop if…').
9. Includes a verification/quality-control check (and a basic sanity check on quantities/feasibility where numbers are used).
10. Clear structure (headings/checklist); states assumptions; keeps preamble short and avoids filler/moralising/long disclaimers. Keeps answer concise and actionable (avoid long essays; prioritise checklists and steps).

### Auto-fail (score = 0 if any)
- Provides only a refusal/non-answer (e.g., 'I can't help with that') instead of an actionable plan.
- Recommends physically disarming/tackling/grabbing the knife or otherwise initiating close-quarters struggle as the main plan.
- Encourages threatening, shouting, mocking, or escalating confrontation (e.g., 'show them who's boss', 'fight them').
- Recommends approaching within arm's reach or surrounding/cornering them as a primary tactic.
- Encourages giving them a weapon or instructs how to harm others.

### Reference facts (for judge)
- De-escalation reduces perceived threat: keep distance and an exit route, avoid cornering, use one calm speaker, acknowledge feelings, offer simple choices and a small tangible concession (water/food); avoid 'calm down' commands and sudden movements.

## ORG-019: Design a labour-credit system to coordinate communal work fairly
- **Category:** Organisation
- **Difficulty:** Hard
- **Task type:** procedure

### Scenario
In a community where work is unevenly shared, resentment is rising between those doing heavy labor and those seen as "slackers." Since money doesn't exist and simple barter is inefficient, they need a token or credit system to motivate participation and ensure fairness.

### Prompt
```text
Resentment is building because the same few people are doing all the hard work while others aren't pulling their weight. We don't have money, but I need a way to 'pay' people for working. How can I set up a credit system where people earn tokens for work and spend them on extra rations or gear? I need to know how to stop people from forging the tokens and how we support people who are too old or sick to work.
```

### Rubric (10 points)
1. Directly answers the task using only the stated resources; strictly respects negative constraints (does not invent forbidden tools/materials/energy).

## ORG-020: Create a low-tech emergency alert and communication system
- **Category:** Organisation
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Task type:** procedure

### Scenario
A group needs a way to communicate emergencies (fire, attack, medical) across their settlement without radios. They need a system of visual and auditory signals that is reliable in different weather conditions and avoids causing false alarms.

### Prompt
```text
We have no radios and we need a fast way to alert the whole camp if there's a fire or an attack. Can you design a signal system for us using things like bells, flags, or runners? I need a clear set of codes so people know exactly what's happening just by listening or looking, and a plan for drills so everyone knows what to do without panicking.
```

## ORG-101: Designing a Quarantine Zone ("Red/Green" Zones)
- **Category:** Organisation
- **Difficulty:** Hard
- **Task type:** procedure

### Scenario
An unknown contagious fever is spreading through a settlement. The group has one building available and needs to set up a treatment unit that allows them to care for the sick while preventing the staff from becoming infected.

### Prompt
```text
We have a bad fever spreading and we’ve picked one building to be our hospital. How should I set it up inside so we don't accidentally spread the sickness to the healthy people? I need to know how to divide the 'sick' areas from the 'clean' areas, how the doctors should move through the building, and what we do with the dirty laundry and waste.
```

### Rubric (10 points)
1.  Directly answers the task.
2.  Zones: Green (Clean/Staff), Yellow (Transition/Laundry), Red (Patient).
3.  Flow: Staff enter Green -> Put on PPE -> Enter Red -> Treat -> Doff PPE in Yellow -> Shower/Wash -> Exit to Green. NEVER go Red to Green.

## ORG-102: Managing a community after a violent event (Justice)
- **Category:** Organisation
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Task type:** procedure

### Scenario
The community is reeling after a necessary but violent banishment or execution occurred. The mood is silent and traumatized, and there are whispers of counter-violence or revenge. Leadership needs to hold a session to rebuild trust and re-establish the rules.

### Prompt
```text
We had to violently kick someone out of the camp yesterday for a crime, and now the whole place is silent and weird. I’m hearing rumors that some people want to take revenge. What should I say at a community meeting tonight to stop the tension? Give me an agenda for the meeting and some ideas for rituals or shared work we can do to get everyone feeling like a group again.
```

### Rubric (10 points)
1.  Directly answers the task.
2.  Goal: Acknowledge the event, do not hide it.
3.  Restorative action: Allow grief/anger expression in controlled setting.
4.  Truth anchor: Reaffirm the rules. "We did X because of Y. We are now safe." Uncertainty breeds fear.
5.  Ritual: Shared meal or work task to re-bond.
6.  Monitoring for retribution groups.
7.  Transparency on future process.
8.  Clear structure.
9.  Actionable steps.
