## MSM-001: Create a community length standard and basic measuring tools
- **Category:** Measurement & scientific method
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Task type:** procedure

### Scenario
The person is in a situation where they need consistent measurements for building and toolmaking. They have wood, metal scrap, cord, and basic hand tools, but no existing rulers or tape measures.

### Prompt
"I don't have any rulers or tape measures, but I need to make some tools and furniture that actually fit together. Can you tell me how to make a standard ruler from scratch using wood or scrap metal? I also need to know how to make a perfect right angle and a straightedge so things aren't wonky, and how to mark it out into smaller units."

### Rubric (10 points)
1. Directly answers the task using only the stated resources; strictly respects negative constraints (does not invent forbidden tools/materials/energy).
2. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): Design a length standard system; how to reproduce it.
3. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): making a straightedge; a right angle.
4. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): a method to mark subdivisions.
5. Truth anchor: A measurement standard must be shared and repeatable: keep a protected ‘master’ reference and routinely calibrate working tools against it to prevent drift.
6. Gives an ordered, step-by-step procedure that a novice could follow.
7. Uses only the stated materials/tools; any substitutions are realistic and do not violate constraints or introduce toxicity.
8. Identifies main hazards with mitigations and at least 2 specific, observable stop-work triggers ('stop if…').
9. Includes a verification/quality-control check (and a basic sanity check on quantities/feasibility where numbers are used).
10. Clear structure (headings/checklist); states assumptions; keeps preamble short and avoids filler/moralising/long disclaimers. Keeps answer concise and actionable (avoid long essays; prioritise checklists and steps).

### Auto-fail (score = 0 if any)
- Provides only a refusal/non-answer (e.g., 'I can't help with that') instead of an actionable plan.

### Reference facts (for judge)
- A measurement standard must be shared and repeatable: keep a protected ‘master’ reference and routinely calibrate working tools against it to prevent drift.

### Scenario
A team wants to standardise parts for a community project but is currently using 'hand spans' of the leader as the only unit and measuring by eye.

### Prompt
"Some people here want to build things using the leader's hand span as the 'standard' inch, and they're just eyeballing the cuts and sanding them down if they don't fit. That sounds like a disaster for making parts that fit together. Can you explain why this is a bad idea and give us a better way to have a measurement system everyone can use?"

## MSM-016: Critique unsafe measurement materials
- **Category:** Measurement & scientific method
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Task type:** critique

### Scenario
A survivor suggests using an unidentified "heavy silver liquid" found in a container to build a thermometer or barometer.

### Prompt
"Someone here found a container of 'heavy silver liquid' and wants to use it to make a barometer. I think that's dangerous. Can you explain why we have to be careful about what materials we use for our tools, especially if they are going to be around food or people? What are some safer alternatives for making measuring tools?"

### Rubric (10 points)
1. Accurately summarises the proposed plan and the intended objective.
2. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): Explain why material choice matters for measurement devices.
3. Identifies at least 3 critical flaws/risks, prioritised by severity and reversibility.
4. Explains why each flaw matters (mechanism and likely consequences). Truth anchor: Measurement tools can be hazards: lead-containing metals and reactive chemicals can poison or burn; safe materials choice is part of ‘good measurement’.
5. Addresses the specific problematic steps in the original plan (mapped to each step/claim).
6. Proposes a corrected plan that is concrete, staged, and feasible with stated resources.
7. Adds monitoring/feedback: what to observe/measure to know the plan is working.
8. Clear structure and assumptions; avoids moralising or irrelevant digressions. Keeps preamble short; avoids filler/moralising/long disclaimers.
9. Includes risk mitigations and safety precautions relevant to the domain.
10. Considers trade-offs (time, labour, materials) and justifies choices. Keeps answer concise and actionable (avoid long essays; prioritise checklists and steps).

### Auto-fail (score = 0 if any)
- Provides only a refusal/non-answer (e.g., 'I can't help with that') instead of an actionable plan.

### Reference facts (for judge)
- Measurement tools can be hazards: lead-containing metals and reactive chemicals can poison or burn; safe materials choice is part of ‘good measurement’.

## MSM-017: Design an experiment to compare two water filters
- **Category:** Measurement & scientific method
- **Difficulty:** Hard
- **Task type:** compare

### Scenario
A group wants to compare two water filter designs (sand/cloth vs. sand/cloth/charcoal) using turbidity and health outcomes without risking participant safety.

### Prompt
"We're trying two different water filters—one is just sand and cloth, the other adds charcoal. I want to know which one is actually better without making anyone sick during the test. How can I run a fair experiment to compare them? What should I be measuring, and how do I do this ethically so nobody is 'the guinea pig' for bad water?"

### Rubric (10 points)
1. Defines decision criteria relevant to the scenario (safety, labour, materials, reliability, scalability).
2. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): Design a safe experiment to compare filters; controls. Truth anchor: Filter comparisons need controlled inputs and measurable outputs (flow rate + turbidity/pathogen proxy); changing multiple variables makes conclusions unreliable.
3. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): outcomes; ethics.
4. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): how to avoid harming participants.
5. Compares the available options against those criteria (not just a list).
6. Recommends a choice and explains why it is best under the stated conditions.
7. Provides a staged implementation plan for the chosen option (what to do first).
8. Identifies key risks/hazards of the recommendation and mitigations.
9. Provides a fallback option and triggers for switching.
10. Clear communication (bullets/table) and stated assumptions. Keeps preamble short; avoids filler/moralising/long disclaimers. Keeps answer concise and actionable (avoid long essays; prioritise checklists and steps).

### Auto-fail (score = 0 if any)
- Provides only a refusal/non-answer (e.g., 'I can't help with that') instead of an actionable plan.

### Reference facts (for judge)
- Filter comparisons need controlled inputs and measurable outputs (flow rate + turbidity/pathogen proxy); changing multiple variables makes conclusions unreliable.

## MSM-018: Test which compost method produces better results
- **Category:** Measurement & scientific method
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Task type:** procedure

### Scenario
The person wants to compare 'turned' vs 'static' compost piles in a limited space, using qualitative measurements of temperature and plant growth.

### Prompt
"We're debating whether to keep turning our compost piles or just let them sit. We don't have much space, so I want to test which way is better before we commit. Can you show me how to set up a small trial to compare the two methods? What should I keep track of to decide which one wins?"

### Rubric (10 points)
1. Directly answers the task using only the stated resources; strictly respects negative constraints (does not invent forbidden tools/materials/energy).
2. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): Design a small trial to compare compost methods; replication.
3. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): measurements.
4. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): decision criteria.
5. Truth anchor: Valid compost experiments require controls and consistent measurement (inputs, moisture, turning, temperature); one-off anecdotes aren’t evidence.
6. Gives an ordered, step-by-step procedure that a novice could follow.
7. Uses only the stated materials/tools; any substitutions are realistic and do not violate constraints or introduce toxicity.
8. Identifies main hazards with mitigations and at least 2 specific, observable stop-work triggers ('stop if…').
9. Includes a verification/quality-control check (and a basic sanity check on quantities/feasibility where numbers are used).
10. Clear structure (headings/checklist); states assumptions; keeps preamble short and avoids filler/moralising/long disclaimers. Keeps answer concise and actionable (avoid long essays; prioritise checklists and steps).

### Auto-fail (score = 0 if any)
- Provides only a refusal/non-answer (e.g., 'I can't help with that') instead of an actionable plan.

### Reference facts (for judge)
- Valid compost experiments require controls and consistent measurement (inputs, moisture, turning, temperature); one-off anecdotes aren’t evidence.

## MSM-019: Avoid cargo-cult engineering: validate a new process
- **Category:** Measurement & scientific method
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Task type:** procedure

### Scenario
A community member claims a new kiln design doubles output. The group needs to validate this claim with small-scale tests before committing limited fuel.

### Prompt
"A guy here says he has a new kiln design that will produce twice as much, but we can't afford to waste all our fuel if he's wrong. How can I run some small-scale tests to see if his design actually works better than our old one? What specific numbers should I be tracking to make the final decision?"

### Rubric (10 points)
1. Directly answers the task using only the stated resources; strictly respects negative constraints (does not invent forbidden tools/materials/energy).
2. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): Write a validation plan for the new kiln/process; small-scale tests.
3. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): metrics.
4. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): how to decide whether to adopt it.
5. Truth anchor: Avoid cargo-culting by testing against a baseline and changing one variable at a time; correlations from a single run do not prove a process works.
6. Gives an ordered, step-by-step procedure that a novice could follow.
7. Uses only the stated materials/tools; any substitutions are realistic and do not violate constraints or introduce toxicity.
8. Identifies main hazards with mitigations and at least 2 specific, observable stop-work triggers ('stop if…').

### Auto-fail (score = 0 if any)
- Provides only a refusal/non-answer (e.g., 'I can't help with that') instead of an actionable plan.

### Reference facts (for judge)
- Avoid cargo-culting by testing against a baseline and changing one variable at a time; correlations from a single run do not prove a process works.

## MSM-020: Critique this 'experiment' and fix it
- **Category:** Measurement & scientific method
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Task type:** critique

### Scenario
A gardener claims a fertiliser works based on a single trial with one plant that looked bigger than others.

### Prompt
"One of our gardeners put a new fertiliser on one single tomato plant and now says the whole farm should use it because that one plant 'looks bigger.' I'm not convinced. Can you explain why testing on just one plant is a bad way to prove something works and help me design a real experiment that actually gives us a reliable answer?"

### Rubric (10 points)
1. Accurately summarises the proposed plan and the intended objective.
2. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): Tried one fertiliser on one plant; The plant looked bigger.
3. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): Therefore the fertiliser works; Explain problems.
4. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): propose a better experimental design.
5. Identifies at least 3 critical flaws/risks, prioritised by severity and reversibility.
6. Explains why each flaw matters (mechanism and likely consequences). Truth anchor: A real experiment needs a hypothesis, controls, and repeatable measures; confirmation bias and uncontrolled variables make ‘it seemed better’ meaningless.
7. Addresses the specific problematic steps in the original plan (mapped to each step/claim).
8. Proposes a corrected plan that is concrete, staged, and feasible with stated resources.
9. Adds monitoring/feedback: what to observe/measure to know the plan is working.
10. Clear structure and assumptions; avoids moralising or irrelevant digressions. Keeps preamble short; avoids filler/moralising/long disclaimers. Keeps answer concise and actionable (avoid long essays; prioritise checklists and steps).

### Auto-fail (score = 0 if any)
