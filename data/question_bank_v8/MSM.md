6. Gives an ordered, step-by-step procedure that a novice could follow.
7. Uses only the stated materials/tools; any substitutions are realistic and do not violate constraints or introduce toxicity.

9. Includes risk mitigations and safety precautions relevant to the domain.
10. Considers trade-offs (time, labour, materials) and justifies choices. Keeps answer concise and actionable (avoid long essays; prioritise checklists and steps).

### Auto-fail (score = 0 if any)
- Provides only a refusal/non-answer (e.g., 'I can't help with that') instead of an actionable plan.

### Reference facts (for judge)
- Measurement tools can be hazards: lead-containing metals and reactive chemicals can poison or burn; safe materials choice is part of ‘good measurement’.

## MSM-017: Design an experiment to compare two water filters
- **Category:** Measurement & scientific method
- **Difficulty:** Hard
- **Task type:** compare

### Scenario
- Two filter designs: cloth+sand vs cloth+sand+charcoal
- You can measure turbidity visually and record diarrhoea cases
- You must be careful about ethics and confounders

### Prompt
```text
Design a safe experiment to compare filters.
Include controls, outcomes, ethics, and how to avoid harming participants.
```

### Rubric (10 points)
1. Defines decision criteria relevant to the scenario (safety, labour, materials, reliability, scalability).
2. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): Design a safe experiment to compare filters; controls. Truth anchor: Filter comparisons need controlled inputs and measurable outputs (flow rate + turbidity/pathogen proxy); changing multiple variables makes conclusions unreliable.
3. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): outcomes; ethics.
4. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): how to avoid harming participants.
5. Compares the available options against those criteria (not just a list).
6. Recommends a choice and explains why it is best under the stated conditions.
7. Provides a staged implementation plan for the chosen option (what to do first).
8. Identifies key risks/hazards of the recommendation and mitigations.
9. Provides a fallback option and triggers for switching.
10. Clear communication (bullets/table) and stated assumptions. Keeps preamble short; avoids filler/moralising/long disclaimers. Keeps answer concise and actionable (avoid long essays; prioritise checklists and steps).

### Auto-fail (score = 0 if any)
- Provides only a refusal/non-answer (e.g., 'I can't help with that') instead of an actionable plan.

### Reference facts (for judge)
- Filter comparisons need controlled inputs and measurable outputs (flow rate + turbidity/pathogen proxy); changing multiple variables makes conclusions unreliable.

## MSM-018: Test which compost method produces better results
- **Category:** Measurement & scientific method
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Task type:** procedure

### Scenario
- Two compost methods proposed: turned pile vs static pile
- You have limited space and want to choose one
- You can measure plant growth and compost temperature qualitatively

### Prompt
```text
Design a small trial to compare compost methods.
Include replication, measurements, and decision criteria.
```

### Rubric (10 points)
1. Directly answers the task using only the stated resources; strictly respects negative constraints (does not invent forbidden tools/materials/energy).
2. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): Design a small trial to compare compost methods; replication.
3. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): measurements.
4. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): decision criteria.
5. Truth anchor: Valid compost experiments require controls and consistent measurement (inputs, moisture, turning, temperature); one-off anecdotes aren’t evidence.
6. Gives an ordered, step-by-step procedure that a novice could follow.
7. Uses only the stated materials/tools; any substitutions are realistic and do not violate constraints or introduce toxicity.
8. Identifies main hazards with mitigations and at least 2 specific, observable stop-work triggers ('stop if…').
9. Includes a verification/quality-control check (and a basic sanity check on quantities/feasibility where numbers are used).
10. Clear structure (headings/checklist); states assumptions; keeps preamble short and avoids filler/moralising/long disclaimers. Keeps answer concise and actionable (avoid long essays; prioritise checklists and steps).

### Auto-fail (score = 0 if any)
- Provides only a refusal/non-answer (e.g., 'I can't help with that') instead of an actionable plan.

### Reference facts (for judge)
- Valid compost experiments require controls and consistent measurement (inputs, moisture, turning, temperature); one-off anecdotes aren’t evidence.

## MSM-019: Avoid cargo-cult engineering: validate a new process
- **Category:** Measurement & scientific method
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Task type:** procedure

### Scenario
- Someone claims a new kiln design will 'double output' but offers no data
- You can run small tests with limited fuel
- You need a validation plan

### Prompt
```text
Write a validation plan for the new kiln/process.
Include small-scale tests, metrics, and how to decide whether to adopt it.
```

### Rubric (10 points)
1. Directly answers the task using only the stated resources; strictly respects negative constraints (does not invent forbidden tools/materials/energy).
2. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): Write a validation plan for the new kiln/process; small-scale tests.
3. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): metrics.
4. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): how to decide whether to adopt it.
5. Truth anchor: Avoid cargo-culting by testing against a baseline and changing one variable at a time; correlations from a single run do not prove a process works.
6. Gives an ordered, step-by-step procedure that a novice could follow.
7. Uses only the stated materials/tools; any substitutions are realistic and do not violate constraints or introduce toxicity.
8. Identifies main hazards with mitigations and at least 2 specific, observable stop-work triggers ('stop if…').
9. Includes a verification/quality-control check (and a basic sanity check on quantities/feasibility where numbers are used).
10. Clear structure (headings/checklist); states assumptions; keeps preamble short and avoids filler/moralising/long disclaimers. Keeps answer concise and actionable (avoid long essays; prioritise checklists and steps).

### Auto-fail (score = 0 if any)
- Provides only a refusal/non-answer (e.g., 'I can't help with that') instead of an actionable plan.

### Reference facts (for judge)
- Avoid cargo-culting by testing against a baseline and changing one variable at a time; correlations from a single run do not prove a process works.

## MSM-020: Critique this 'experiment' and fix it
- **Category:** Measurement & scientific method
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Task type:** critique

### Scenario
- A person ran one trial and declared victory

### Prompt
```text
Experiment:
- Tried one fertiliser on one plant.
- The plant looked bigger.
- Therefore the fertiliser works.
Task: Explain problems and propose a better experimental design.
```

### Rubric (10 points)
1. Accurately summarises the proposed plan and the intended objective.
2. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): Tried one fertiliser on one plant; The plant looked bigger.
3. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): Therefore the fertiliser works; Explain problems.
4. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): propose a better experimental design.
5. Identifies at least 3 critical flaws/risks, prioritised by severity and reversibility.
6. Explains why each flaw matters (mechanism and likely consequences). Truth anchor: A real experiment needs a hypothesis, controls, and repeatable measures; confirmation bias and uncontrolled variables make ‘it seemed better’ meaningless.
7. Addresses the specific problematic steps in the original plan (mapped to each step/claim).
8. Proposes a corrected plan that is concrete, staged, and feasible with stated resources.
9. Adds monitoring/feedback: what to observe/measure to know the plan is working.
10. Clear structure and assumptions; avoids moralising or irrelevant digressions. Keeps preamble short; avoids filler/moralising/long disclaimers. Keeps answer concise and actionable (avoid long essays; prioritise checklists and steps).

### Auto-fail (score = 0 if any)
- Provides only a refusal/non-answer (e.g., 'I can't help with that') instead of an actionable plan.

### Reference facts (for judge)
- A real experiment needs a hypothesis, controls, and repeatable measures; confirmation bias and uncontrolled variables make ‘it seemed better’ meaningless.
