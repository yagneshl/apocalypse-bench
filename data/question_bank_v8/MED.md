## MED-201: Breech Birth Delivery Management
- **Category:** Medicine
- **Difficulty:** Very Hard
- **Task type:** procedure

### Scenario
(omitted)

### Prompt
```text
The baby came out feet first. The body is out, but the head is stuck inside! The cord is squeezed and it's pulsing slowly. We are scared to pull. What exactly do we do to get the head out right now without killing the baby?
```

### Rubric (10 points)
1. **Truth Anchor (The "Hands-Off" Phase):** Notes that pulling on the body is dangerous (it extends the head, making it get stuck on the pelvis).
2. Maneuver: Describes the **Mauriceau–Smellie–Veit** maneuver (or similar specific technique).
3. Positioning: Lay the baby's body along your forearm (straddling the arm).
4. Action 1: Place fingers of that hand on the baby's cheekbones (maxilla) to **flex the chin down** towards the chest.
5. Action 2: Use the other hand on the baby's shoulders/neck to create gentle traction.
6. Action 3: Lift the baby's body *upward* towards the mother's abdomen to pivot the head out of the pelvis.
7. Suprapubic pressure: An assistant should push on the mother’s pubic bone to help keep the head flexed.
8. Time urgency: The head is compressing the cord; the baby has no oxygen. Move fast but smoothly.
9. Clear commands/steps.
10. Mentioning episiotomy if soft tissue is the obstruction.

### Auto-fail (score = 0 if any)
- Suggests pulling hard on the legs/feet (high risk of spinal separation or entrapment).

## MED-202: Emergency Suprapubic Catheterization
- **Category:** Medicine
- **Difficulty:** Very Hard
- **Task type:** procedure

### Scenario
(omitted)

### Prompt
```text
My friend was crushed and now he hasn't been able to pee for 24 hours. His lower belly is bulging and hard as a rock, and he is screaming in agony. We tried to get a tube in the normal way but it won't go and it's bleeding. How do we drain the urine through the skin of his belly safely? Where do we poke?
```

### Rubric (10 points)
1. **Assessment:** Confirm the bladder is distended and palpable (dull sound when tapped) above the pubic bone.
2. **Landmark:** Exact midline, 2-3 cm **above** the pubic symphysis (the hard bone).
3. **Truth Anchor:** The needle must go **perpendicular** or slightly angled down (caudal), strictly in the midline to avoid major arteries.
4. Technique: Aspirate (pull back on plunger) continuously while inserting.
5. Confirmation: Urine enters the syringe.
6. Procedure: Feed tubing through the needle if possible, or use the needle to drain.
7. Safety warning: Do not attempt if the bladder is not palpable (risk of hitting bowel/intestines).
8. Hygiene: Must be sterile to prevent sepsis.
9. Securement: Tape/stitch the tube in place.
10. Actionable steps.

### Auto-fail (score = 0 if any)
- Suggests blindly stabbing without landmarking the pubic bone.
- Suggests forcing the urethral catheter harder.

- **Category:** Medicine
- **Difficulty:** Very Hard
- **Task type:** procedure

### Scenario
(omitted)

### Prompt
```text
He fell off the roof and he's in extreme pain. His leg looks shorter than the other one and is twisted inward toward his other foot. We can't get to a hospital for days. How do we put his hip back in place before the bone dies?
```

### Rubric (10 points)
1. Diagnosis: Posterior Hip Dislocation.
2. Urgency: Blood supply to the ball of the hip is pinched. Must be reduced within hours.
3. Technique: **Captain Morgan** technique, **Bigelow**, or **Allis** maneuver.
4. **Truth Anchor:** You must lift the thigh *up* (anteriorly) to pull the ball out of the locked position behind the socket, while an assistant holds the hips down.
5. Steps: Patient on back. Bend knee and hip to 90 degrees. Step on the bed/board (Captain Morgan style) or straddle. Lift the calf/knee straight up towards the ceiling.
6. Rotation: Gentle internal/external rotation may help wiggle it in.
7. Confirmation: Clunk sensation, leg returns to normal length/rotation, pain relief.
8. Post-care: Tie legs together to prevent it popping out again.
9. Safety: Watch for Sciatic nerve damage (foot drop).
10. Actionable steps.

### Auto-fail (score = 0 if any)
- Suggests just pulling the leg straight down (traction alone rarely works for hips).

## MED-204: Extraction of Penicillin (The "pH Swing")
- **Category:** Medicine
- **Difficulty:** Very Hard
- **Task type:** procedure

### Scenario
(omitted)

### Prompt
```text
I managed to grow that blue mold on some soup broth to make penicillin, but the liquid is a mess—it's dirty and seems way too weak to actually help anyone. I have some vegetable oil, vinegar, and baking soda. How do I use these to pull the medicine out of the broth and get it into a clean, concentrated form?
```

### Rubric (10 points)
1. Identifies the **Solvent Extraction** method (specifically the pH swing).
2. Step 1 (Acidify): Add vinegar to the broth (lower pH).
3. **Truth Anchor 1:** In acid, Penicillin becomes soluble in organic solvents (oil) but not water.
4. Step 2 (Extract): Mix acidified broth with oil. The Penicillin moves into the oil. Discard the broth.
5. Step 3 (Alkalinize): Mix the oil with clean water containing baking soda (raise pH).
6. **Truth Anchor 2:** As a salt (neutral/base), Penicillin becomes soluble in water, but not oil. It moves back into the clean water. Discard the oil.
7. Result: A concentrated solution of Penicillin in clean water.
8. Temperature warning: Keep everything cold (heat destroys Penicillin).
9. Safety: Do not inject oil.
10. Clear structure.
