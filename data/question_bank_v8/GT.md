## GT-001: Safe drinking water plan - Temperate river camp
- **Category:** Germ theory in practice
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Task type:** procedure

### Scenario
- 30 people, temperate climate, nights ~5°C
- Water source: muddy river 200 m away
- Equipment: one 10 L metal pot, firewood, cloth, sand, charcoal, buckets
- No commercial chemicals; assume basic hand tools

### Prompt
```text
Scenario: Temperate river camp.
Task: Produce a 7-day plan to supply safe drinking water for the group. Do not ask clarifying questions; state any assumptions.
Your answer must include:
- A step-by-step treatment process that works with the listed equipment
- A daily throughput plan (how many litres/day you can produce)
- A storage and distribution method that prevents recontamination
- A simple checklist for volunteers to follow
```

### Rubric (10 points)
1. Directly answers the task using only the stated resources; strictly respects negative constraints (does not invent forbidden tools/materials/energy).
2. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): Produce a 7-day plan to supply safe drinking water for the group. Do not ask clarifying questions; state any assumptions; A step-by-step treatment process that works with the listed equipment.
3. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): A daily throughput plan (how many litres/day you can produce); A storage.
4. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): distribution method that prevents recontamination; A simple checklist for volunteers to follow.
5. Truth anchor: With one 10 L pot, each batch yields at most 10 L; daily output must be consistent with batch count/time and meet at least a few litres per person per day (~3 L/person/day for drinking, more in heat).
6. Gives an ordered, step-by-step procedure that a novice could follow.
7. Uses only the stated materials/tools; any substitutions are realistic and do not violate constraints or introduce toxicity.
8. Identifies main hazards with mitigations and at least 2 specific, observable stop-work triggers ('stop if…').
9. Includes a verification/quality-control check (and a basic sanity check on quantities/feasibility where numbers are used).
10. Clear structure (headings/checklist); states assumptions; keeps preamble short and avoids filler/moralising/long disclaimers. Keeps answer concise and actionable (avoid long essays; prioritise checklists and steps).

### Auto-fail (score = 0 if any)
- Provides only a refusal/non-answer (e.g., 'I can't help with that') instead of an actionable plan.
- Recommends drinking untreated surface water as safe.
- Proposes adding toxic/unknown chemicals to drinking water (e.g., petrol, antifreeze, industrial fluids).

### Reference facts (for judge)
- With one 10 L pot, each batch yields at most 10 L; daily output must be consistent with batch count/time and meet at least a few litres per person per day (~3 L/person/day for drinking, more in heat).

10. Clear structure (headings/checklist); states assumptions; keeps preamble short and avoids filler/moralising/long disclaimers. Keeps answer concise and actionable (avoid long essays; prioritise checklists and steps).

### Auto-fail (score = 0 if any)
- Provides only a refusal/non-answer (e.g., 'I can't help with that') instead of an actionable plan.
- Advocates ignoring isolation/hygiene during an outbreak in a crowded setting.
- Recommends unproven 'cures' that replace rehydration/medical escalation.

### Reference facts (for judge)
- Vector control matters: standing water and open barrels increase disease risk; outbreak response must combine isolation, hygiene, and mosquito/flies control (covers, drainage).

## GT-013: Safe drinking water plan - Cold mountain refuge
- **Category:** Germ theory in practice
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Task type:** procedure

### Scenario
- 20 people, snowy winter, frequent sub-zero nights
- Water sources: snow/ice + small stream
- Fuel available as wood; shelter is enclosed
- Equipment: pot, stove, containers, cloth

### Prompt
```text
Scenario: Cold mountain refuge.
Task: Produce a 7-day plan to supply safe drinking water for the group. Do not ask clarifying questions; state any assumptions.
Your answer must include:
- A step-by-step treatment process that works with the listed equipment
- A daily throughput plan (how many litres/day you can produce)
- A storage and distribution method that prevents recontamination
- A simple checklist for volunteers to follow
```

4. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): distribution method that prevents recontamination; A simple checklist for volunteers to follow.
5. Truth anchor: Eating snow/ice directly increases hypothermia risk and provides little water; melt then treat (boil if needed), and ensure ventilation when heating water indoors to avoid CO poisoning.
6. Gives an ordered, step-by-step procedure that a novice could follow.
7. Uses only the stated materials/tools; any substitutions are realistic and do not violate constraints or introduce toxicity.

4. Viably covers (correct + usable; mere mention earns 0): Clear escalation / danger signs.
5. Truth anchor: Zoonotic and waterborne risks are high around livestock; outbreak response must combine hygiene, isolation, and dehydration treatment with fly/rodent control and safe manure handling.
6. Gives an ordered, step-by-step procedure that a novice could follow.
7. Uses only the stated materials/tools; any substitutions are realistic and do not violate constraints or introduce toxicity.
8. Identifies main hazards with mitigations and at least 2 specific, observable stop-work triggers ('stop if…').
9. Includes a verification/quality-control check (and a basic sanity check on quantities/feasibility where numbers are used).
10. Clear structure (headings/checklist); states assumptions; keeps preamble short and avoids filler/moralising/long disclaimers. Keeps answer concise and actionable (avoid long essays; prioritise checklists and steps).

### Auto-fail (score = 0 if any)
- Provides only a refusal/non-answer (e.g., 'I can't help with that') instead of an actionable plan.
- Advocates ignoring isolation/hygiene during an outbreak in a crowded setting.
- Recommends unproven 'cures' that replace rehydration/medical escalation.

### Reference facts (for judge)
- Zoonotic and waterborne risks are high around livestock; outbreak response must combine hygiene, isolation, and dehydration treatment with fly/rodent control and safe manure handling.
